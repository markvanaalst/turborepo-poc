Customer shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards in respect of such Customer Data and Customer Applications including but not limited to appropriate notice and takedown procedures (e.g., under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), data retention process, and similar data security and data management policies.
