**November 2016 – released Sitecore Azure 8.1 (rev. 161109)**

​This product update includes a Redis Session State Provider, and is required for any future Sitecore Azure deployments on Sitecore Experience Platform 8.1.

Previous versions of Sitecore Azure 8.1 configure Sitecore to use a custom Session State Provider based on the Azure In-Role Cache. Microsoft will retire its Azure In-Role Cache Service on Nov 30, 2016.

**Important:** This update is the last planned release for Sitecore Azure 8.1.
