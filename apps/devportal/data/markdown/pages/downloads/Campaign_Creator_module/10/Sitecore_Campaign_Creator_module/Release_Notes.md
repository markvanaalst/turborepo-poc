## Campaign Creator

The Sitecore Campaign Creator provides a simple and effective way for marketers to create new campaign activities and apply taxonomy in order classify campaign activities into larger campaign groups. You can:

-   Create new campaign activities and generate campaign tracking codes.
-   Apply taxonomy facets for classification purposes.
-   Search for campaigns by facet, date and name.
-   Link to Experience Analytics for single campaign activity performance view
-   Export lists of campaign activities.

### Campaign Creator overview

-   Campaign Creator is available as an optional module to provide a user friendly interface to create, classify and search for campaigns, building on functionality currently found in the Marketing Control Panel.
-   Campaign Creator also acts as an entry point to specific campaign activities in Experience Analytics, providing granular single campaign activity performance view. This replaces the Reports tab that was found in campaign items prior to Sitecore 8.0.
-   Taxonomy that is defined in the Marketing Control can be used in Campaign Creator to organize campaign activities by facets, in line with the customerâ€™s overall marketing strategy.
-   Campaign Creator provides easy access to campaign codes so that marketers can differentiate and track all elements of their marketing mix to any desired degree of detail.

### Campaign Creator features

This enables marketers to gather more detailed information about how effective various channels and campaign activities are at generating traffic and engagement value.

    -   Additional filtering by campaign activity name and validity dates.
-   Campaign activities are automatically published upon creation.
-   Campaign activities are automatically unpublished upon deletion.
