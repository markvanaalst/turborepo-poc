The SDK is a framework that is designed to help the developer produce native mobile applications that use and serve content that is managed by Sitecore. The framework enables developers to rapidly develop applications utilizing their existing .NET development skill sets. The SDK includes the following features:

-   Fetching CMS Content
-   Create, Delete, Update Items
-   Downloading Media Resources

This release of the SDK supports the new API that Sitecore provides to interact with content from Sitecore â€“ the Sitecore Services Client (SSC). The new SSC Web API follows updated web practices to provide endpoints on which to source content from Sitecore. The SSC Web API is also designed to replace the legacy Item Web API module that the previous SDK was based upon. The SSC client is distributed by default in the 8.1 and 8.2 releases.

The library is PCL standard compliant and can be used on the following platforms:

-   iOS 8 and newer
-   Android 4.0 and newer
-   Windows Desktop (.NET 4.5)
-   Windows Phone 8.1 and newer

It uses the modern C# approaches such as :

-   PCL distribution
-   async/await based API
-   Fluent interface
