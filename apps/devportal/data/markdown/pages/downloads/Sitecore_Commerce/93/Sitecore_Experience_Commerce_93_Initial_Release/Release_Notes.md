**Jan 2020 – released Sitecore Experience Commerce 9.3 Initial Release**

Sitecore Commerce 9.3 focuses on increased solution performance and ability to scale, along with functional enhancements and corrective content.

## New features/improvements

 | Area | Description | TFS no. |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | Scalability - Indexing | Added a new Commerce based index that replaces the Sitecore Master and Web indexing of Commerce managed items. Significantly reduces the time to index Commerce items, due in part to reducing communications between Sitecore and the Engine.  <br />Azure Search with on-prem -- As a result of this feature, on-prem deployments using SIF no longer support automatic configuration of Azure Search. This needs to configured separately after installation if you wish to use Azure Search with an on-prem deployment. Cloud deployments have not changed.  <br />Content Editor Indexing Functionality -- Indexing for catalog items can still be done from the Indexing Manager in XP, but  you can also index catalog items using Postman. Indexing from Postman does not add/remove content items in the index, it's only for catalog items.  New Postman samples have been provided in the SDK.  <br />[Link to documentation for incremental index update](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/93/sitecore-experience-commerce/en/incremental-index-updates.html) | 350723 |
 | Scalability - response time | Replaced the cache in CE Connect with the centralize Redis cache. This resolved the presence of intermittent spikes in response times when testing of large distributed deployments under relatively high loads.  <br />[Link to documentation on commerce engine connect caching](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/93/sitecore-experience-commerce/en/commerce-engine-connect-caching.html) | 360554 |
 | Scalability - page view rate | Reduced the depth of pipeline calls, and the allocation of tasks. Avoided calling commands that only calls a pipeline; called the pipeline directly instead. Avoided calling pipelines within blocks, when the pipeline can be added as a block of the main pipeline. Avoided the use of Task.Run. Used ConfigureAwait(false) in async methods. Removed non-value blocks from pipelines, e.g. those that return same object without modifications.  <br /> | 349201, 351012, 351018, 339399 |
 | Scalability - checkout rate | Combined the price and stock API call from the Storefront to the Commerce Engine using method GetSelleableItemSummary, to improve performance.  <br /> | 343121, 342890 |
 | Scalability - promotions | Added search to the Business Tools for promotions, which required adding promotions to the Commerce index. This reduces the time to retrieve promotions in the Business Tools by avoiding needing to load all promotions from the list. Translated most of the filtering blocks in the IDiscoverPromotionsPipeline into search filter criteria in the search. Added a new Promotions index accordingly.  <br />[Link to documentation on commerce search and indexing](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/93/sitecore-experience-commerce/en/commerce-search-and-indexing.html) | 359226 |
 | Scalability - price cards | Added search to the Business Tools for price cards, which required adding price cards to the Commerce index. This reduces the time to retrieve price cards in the Business Tools by avoiding needing to load all price cards from the list.  <br />[Link to documentation on how to work with price books](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/93/sitecore-experience-commerce/en/work-with-price-books.html)[Link to documentation on commerce search and indexing](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/93/sitecore-experience-commerce/en/commerce-search-and-indexing.html) | 359225 |

 | Sellable item associations | Added the ability to change a parent association from the sellable item, instead of needing to create the association from the new parent (where finding the sellable item could be cumbersome).  <br />[Link to documentation on working with a sellable item](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/93/sitecore-experience-commerce/en/work-with-a-sellable-item.html) | 276437 |

## Resolved issues

 | Area | Description | TFS no. |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | Engine Indexing | Improved the performance of indexing performance via a new Commerce-based index that replaces the current Sitecore Master and Web indexing, for Commerce items.  <br /> | 307147 |
 | Engine Indexing | Resolved an issue where rebuilding the index failed where the SellableItem was associated to more than one Catalog and one of the Catalogs was not selected in Sitecore Content Editor.  <br /> | 347458 |
 | Performance | Improved performance of the PopulateCartLineItemsBlock by using multithreading instead of using a time-consuming foreach loop.  <br /> | 326211 |
 | Engine authentication | Resolved an issue were Sitecore could not connect to the Commerce Engine when the certificate thumbprint was in lowercase. This was resolved by making the checking criteria case insensitive.  <br /> | 342268 |
 | Engine | Resolved a Transaction Exception that was thrown when SqlCommand objects are not correctly disposed of if the corresponding SqlConnection is reused.  <br /> | 351686 |
 | Engine | Resolved an issue where an InvalidShop error appears…"Shop 'CommerceEngineDefaultStorefront' does not exist." when syncing Control Panel items with the Engine, for example after stopping and restarting the Content Management role and the Commerce Engine.  <br /> | 358019 |
 | Engine | Resolved an issue with Minions that run for long periods of time, where a concurrency errors appeared in the Engine logs.  <br /> | 336882 |

 | Engine | Resolved an issue where the SqlDataReader remained open within Sitecore.Commerce.Plugin.SQL.GetListEntitiesCommand.  <br /> | 354104 |
 | Catalog mappings | Resolved an issue where in-memory mappings collection, CatalogRepository.MappingEntries, gets emptied if there is a failure in reloading mappings. Now if the mappings does not get loaded properly, e.g. due to network failure or timeout, then it continues using previously loaded in-memory mappings.  <br /> | 347551 |
 | Catalog associations | Resolved a limitation in dissociating a category from another category causes the category to be incorrectly removed from the display in the Sitecore Content Editor, because the ParentCatalogList was removed.  <br /> | 336979 |

This issue occurred when the sellableItem had been associated with multiple categories across more than one catalog.  <br /> | 352513 |
 | Pricing | Fixed an issue where the price card snapshot applied to a product variant was not correctly removed after having disabled that variant.  <br /> | 358297 |

 | Business Tools | Improved the navigation to view the inventory of a sellable item. Selecting the Inventory Set for a product variant now navigates to the inventory page where the product variant is located as expected, instead of navigating to the first page of the inventory set.  <br /> | 324042 |

 | Connect | Resolved an "Object reference not set to an instance of an object." exception that was thrown when on initializing the PreviousStateName value was not initialized and could not be read.  <br /> | 310923 |
 | Connect - personalization | Resolved limitations preventing setting up inventory personalization rules, in Connect.  <br /> | 281116 |
 | Connect - personalization | Resolved an issue where the Checkout button was not displayed on the Storefront after creating a personalization rule involving setting a Specific Product Quantity Condition.  <br /> | 326232 |
 | Connect - personalization | Resolved an issue where the Checkout button was not displayed on the Storefront after creating a personalization rule involving setting a Total Product Quantity Condition.  <br /> | 251521 |
