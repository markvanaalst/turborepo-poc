**April 2017 â€“ released Sitecore Experience Accelerator 1.3 (rev. 170412)**

Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) enables parallel work streams (content, creative design, UX, coding) to not only reduce the time required to produce a website, but also improve the quality by allowing all contributors to validate each other's contributions. SXA provides reusable user experience layouts and components, while fully integrating into the Sitecore editing experience.

## Highlights

-   SXA now supports Bootstrap, Foundation, and 960GS CSS frameworks.
-   The new SXA Data Modelling allows editors to compose and deliver JSON for Single-Page Applications (SPAs) or mobile applications.
