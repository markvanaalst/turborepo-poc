**August 2016 – released Sitecore Experience Accelerator 1.0 (rev. 160815)**

The Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) enables parallel work streams (content, creative design, UX, coding) that not only reduce the time required to produce a website, but also improve the quality of the website by allowing all contributors validate each other's contributions. SXA provides reusable user experience layouts and components, while fully integrating into the Sitecore editing experience.

-   Users can create pages and enter content while running the creative design process in parallel.
Site architects can create a wireframe version of the website within Sitecore.-   Content authors and UI designers can work simultaneously on the wireframe site.
-   Content authors can enter real content into the wireframe environment.
-   UI designers can work on an exported version of the wireframe site using their favorite tools and the Experience Accelerator Creative Exchange synchronizes the UI design back into Sitecore.

SXA enables back-end developers to work on integration with external systems and custom components while content authors and creative designers are working in their areas at the same time.
