## Welcome to Sitecore Accelerate Cookbook

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of our highly anticipated Sitecore Accelerate Cookbook for XM Cloud! ðŸš€

Sitecore Accelerate is a dedicated program to help Sitecore customers upgrade their existing PaaS CMS or commerce solution to our next-gen SaaS products.

The Accelerate cookbook provides a set of recipes to guide your Partner through an XM Cloud implementation or transition from our core PaaS products (Experience Manager/Experience Platform)

> NOTE: This cookbook is a work in progress.
