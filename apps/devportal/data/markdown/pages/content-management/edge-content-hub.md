## Introduction

Sitecore Experience Edge for Content Hub is the solution for brands and organizations that manage content for multiple functions and audiences using numerous devices.

Experience Edge is a set of services for headless content delivery, and is based on the Content as a Service (CaaS) model that focuses on managing content into feeds. These feeds mean that other applications and properties can consume and use the content according to their particular needs.

The content is hosted by Sitecore Content Hubâ„¢ in the cloud, and it is offered to consumers who need it delivered into any applications or systems whenever required. The content delivered is raw; it can be anything and go anywhere
